        Visit a website that interests you. Write a one-page summary of the site
        
      </p>
      
        
          What is the URL of the site?
          <p>=> <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/"> https://www.apple.com/ </a></strong></p>
        
       
         <p> The purpose of the site is to provide information about Apple's
            products and services to its customers or potentials customers. It
            is also an online platform where people can purchase their products.
          </p>
        <p>
          
            The intended audience is anyone who wants to buy an electronic
            device (iPhones, Macs laptops, iPads, Apple Watches, Airpods, etc)
          </p>
        <p>Anyone interested in purchasing an Apple product can
            easily find the website and browse all their products and check all
            the specifications.
          </p>
        <p> It helps me stay up to date with their technologies,
            services and products. And I can check any information I might need.
          </p>
        <p>Apple's website has a clean and minimalist design,
                    with a white background and black text (or vice-versa) which makes
                    it easy to read. Their choice of colors provide a perfect contrast to make the site visually appealing</p>
                Images and multimedia are used throughout the
                    website, with high-quality pictures showcasing their products and
                    services. 
               The website's organization provides an ease of navigation, it is
                    divided into clear sections, links are visible which makes it ease
                    to navigate. The navigation bar sums up all their products so you
                    directly go to your desired product.
             
                  </p>
          
         <p>I would encourage others the visit the website. It is a very informative website. Even if you don't intend to buy anything, you can browse the website and see their latest technologies, they provide full specifications for each of their products. </p>
          
          <p>  The website is in general user-friendly, but they could make it more accessible for users with disabilities. Adding features such as closed captioning, audio descriptions, and other accessibility options would help make the website more inclusive and usable for a wider range of users </p>
