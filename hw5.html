          <em> How Amazon.com</em> (http://www.amazon.com) and
          <em>Alibaba.com</em>
          (https://www.alibaba.com/) exhibit the design principles of
          repetition, contrast, proximity, and alignment

          <p class="mt-2">
            <strong> Repetition:</strong> Both Amazon.com and Alibaba.com use
            repetition to create a cohesive and consistent design. The company
            logo is repeated in the upper left corner of every page, and the
            navigation menu is repeated across the top of every page.
            Additionally, the search bar and categories of products are
            consistently placed in the same location on each page. Both sites
            also use repetition to display product listings, with each item
            being presented in a similar format across the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Contrast:</strong> Both Amazon.com and Alibaba.com use
            contrast to make important elements stand out. Call-to-action
            buttons are in a contrasting color to make them stand out from the
            rest of the page. Both sites also use contrasting colors and font
            sizes to highlight important information such as sale prices,
            ratings, and customer reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong> Proximity:</strong> Both Amazon.com and Alibaba.com use
            proximity to group related elements together. Both sites group
            related product information together, such as product images,
            descriptions, and customer reviews. And also products in the same
            category are placed together.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Both Amazon.com and Alibaba.com use
            alignment to create a sense of order and structure on their pages.
            For example, product listings are aligned in a grid format, with
            each item being the same size and shape. Both sites also use
            alignment to create a hierarchy of information, with important
            elements such as product titles and prices being aligned in a
            consistent manner.
